              uses a special panel in Blender to read a .zip file.

              In this chapter an overview of the addon, as well as an import and
              export example is given. If you work yourself through this

            <h3 id="first-steps-overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The addon is located in a

              There are 5 Sub-Panels: Import, Export, Direct Conversion,
              Attachment, Shading and Unzip PK3s. You can find more details

              Additionally the addon prints verbose log output to the system
              console. It will print debug, info and warning messages. You can
              open the system console under

            <p>
              In this section we are going to import and assemble a game
              character from the game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. Game
              characters are made up of many different parts. The main parts
              are: body, head, helmet and accessoires like the backpack. These
              parts are stored in different model formats: MD3 or MDC for head,
              helmet or accessoire models; and MDS or MDM/MDX for the body
              models.

            <p>
              Before we start we should do 2 things: 1) extract the game data
              from pk3 files and 2) find out where our different model parts are
              located on disk.

            </h5>
            <p>
              At some point in this example (during shading or attachment) the
              addon needs to have a reference to a directory which contains all
              the game data in uncompressed form. Game data for RtCW and W:ET is
              mostly located in compressed files whose names end with
              <q>.pk3</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use the <span class="txt-h1">Unzip PK3s panel</span> to extract
              all the .pk3 files from the game. See chapter
              <a href="#panel-description-unzip-pk3s">Unzip PK3s</a> for more
              details. For the input field called
              <span class="txt-h1">Source Filepath</span> search for your
              <span class="txt-h1"

              >. For the input field called
              <span class="txt-h1">Target Filepath</span> create a

              Make sure enough space is left on your disk, as the operation will

              The information is either directly containing a reference to the
              model files (see <q>mesh</q> or <q>hudhead</q> key) or it
              references other script files (for example <q>animationgroup</q>).
              The picture above marks the information needed for the body model
              and the head model. That will be our starting point.

              The mesh data for the body is located in .mdm files. The animation
              data is separated and stored in .mdx files. This way different
              meshes can
              <span class="txt-h2">reuse the same animation data</span>. This is
              different compared to RtCW, as RtCW stores all its data for a body
              model in a single .mds file.
            </p>
            <p>
              We already have the location of the body file for our allied
              engineer, but we still need to figure out where its animation data
              from the .mdx files is located. We can find this information by
              following the <q>animationgroup</q>
              key-value pair from the .char file.
              <span class="txt-h1"

              reveals many different .mdx locations for this character. We
              choose <q>body.mdx</q> for this example as it is basically the
              main animation file used by all 10 characters of the game.

              For attachment of the head model to the body model we need to use
              a little magic again, as this information is hard coded in the
              source code. During run time, the game will load a lot of
              information for attaching the models onto special places of other
              models. These places are called
              <span class="txt-h2"><q>tags</q></span
              >. Our magic information tells us that there is a tag called
              <q>tag_head</q> on the body model. Tags are represented as empties
              with the prefix <q>tag_</q> and display type <q>ARROWS</q> within
              Blender.
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >Let's go into the collection for the body model and find this
                tag, just so we see how it looks like.</span

              There are 3 kind of tags within the model formats. This one is
              attached to a bone with an offset. But there are also tags for
              bones without an offset and tags without any parent. We will
              attach the head model to this tag object by using the
              <span class="txt-h1">Attachment Panel</span>. As the
              <span class="txt-h1"

              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              The method we chose attaches the objects within a selected
              collection to an active tag object.
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >First deselect everything, then select the collection for the

              >. It is important that you select the tag object last, as only
              the active object will be considered a tag object by the addon.
              <span class="txt-h1">Click the Attach Button</span>. The result is
              that all objects of the collection (our head collection) will be

              W:ET uses <span class="txt-h2">.skin files</span> to configure the
              information for accessoire models of the body model. It is usually
              located at the same place of the .mdm file we just imported. Let's
              take a look at <q>models/players/temperate/allied/engineer</q> and
              beside the .mdm file in this folder you will also find a .skin
              file called <span class="txt-h1"><q>body_engineer.skin</q></span
              >. The file encodes shading and attachment information.

            <p>
              The information is made up of
              <span class="txt-h1">key-value pairs</span>. For example
              <q>md3_hat</q> defines the helmet model found at
              <q>models/players/temperate/allied/helmet.md3</q>. This helmet
              model is supposed to be attached to a tag object. Unlike the
              information for shading which describes real surface names (for
              example <q>l_legs</q>), the name for the tags are again ...
              magical. You have to browse the source to find out the actual
              name. For example <q>md3_hat</q> maps to <q>tag_mouth</q>. To make
              it a bit more confusing, <q>tag_mouth</q> is actually located in
              the head model, not the body model.
            </p>
            <p>
              The addon provides a method to read these .skin files and
              automatically import and attach the accessoire models. Go to the
              <span class="txt-h1">Attachment Panel</span> of the addon and
              <span class="txt-h1">switch the method to <q>Skinfile</q></span

            <!-- Import of a Character: Shading -->
            <h4>Shading</h4>
            <p>
              Shading just means we tell the game how to put color on the
              surfaces (in Blender these are the individual objects) of the
              model. It basically defines surface properties which tell the game
              how light interacts with the surface, for example to make it
              transparent, or to use multiple textures and blend them together.
              The game uses so called
              <span class="txt-h2"><q>shader names</q></span> for that.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this addon, the shader name of a surface is encoded into the
              <span class="txt-h1">material name</span> of an object inside
              Blender. If there is no material after import, then this is
              totally normal. This just means the game uses .skin files to shade
              the model. If we look at our imported models in Blender and expand
              their outliner views, then we can see that only the backpack model
              contains materials. Note the names of the materials, these are
              relative paths to the game path.
            </p>

              The <span class="txt-h1">Shading Panel</span> therefore provides

              Let's do the shading by material names first. In the Shading
              Panel, the
              <span class="txt-h1">input field called <q>Game Path</q></span>
              should be already set from the
              <a href="#first-steps-import-accessoires">previous chapter</a>. To
              see the shading, we must
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >switch <q>Viewport Shading</q> to <q>Look Dev</q> mode</span
              >. Then we
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >select the backpack collection to make it active</span
              >
              and <span class="txt-h1">click the Apply Shading Button</span> in
              the Shading Panel.

            <p>
              Now for that <span class="txt-h2">shader name</span> again. This
              is a
              <span class="txt-h2"
                >reference to either a texture or shader script</span
              >. Shader scripts are made up of small code snippets defining
              surface properties. Each code snippet is headed with a shader
              name. If the game does not find such a shader name in one of these
              script files, it will
              <span class="txt-h2">resort to finding a texture</span> with that
              name.
              <span class="txt-h2"
                >First it will search for .tga files, then for .jpg files</span
              >. That is how the game finds its color info for the surfaces of
              the model.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >We need to use .skin files to shade the rest of the
                objects.</span
              >
              The .skin files are usually located in the same directory as the
              model itself. Here are their locations. Remember to use the
              absolute path.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="txt-h1">Shading by Skinfile</span> works the same way

                fields, and click the button.</span
              >
              The addon will then read the .skin file information and apply the
              shading. After doing this for all three collections we get the
              additional shading information.

                shade</span
              >: its the strap surface of the helmet, and the rank model itself.
              The strap surface shading is a limitation of the addon: it simply
              can't read shader scripts yet. We have to manually do that in
              Blender if we want to. The rank model is shaded dependent on the
              rank of the player ingame and this information is hardcoded within
              the source code.

            <h5 id="first-steps-fixing-strap">Fixing the strap surface</h5>
            <p>
              The shader name for the strap surface is defined in the
              helmet_engineer.skin file. This is a good time to explain
              <span class="txt-h2">how shading works for .skin files</span>,
              because as we saw above, a .skin file can also contain information
              about attachment. A .skin file uses
              <span class="txt-h1">key-value pairs</span> to do the shading for
              a model. The
              <span class="txt-h1">key is be the object name</span> (or surface
              name as the game calls them), and the
              <span class="txt-h1">value is the shader name</span>.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              The strap surface has a
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >shader name called
                <q>models/players/temperate/allied/strap</q></span
              >. After searching all .shader files from the game we can find out
              that this shader is located in a file at:
              <q>scripts/models_players.shader</q>. The shader script has 2
              lines: the first line tells the engine to draw the surface from
              both sides (culling disabled). The second line contains the
              reference to a texture. We will use that texture for shading.
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure class="remt-pic-explain">
                <img

            </p>
            <p>
              As already mentioned, the addon does not support reading shader
              scripts, so we just copy the path to the texture which is:
              <span class="txt-h1"
                ><q>models/players/temperate/allied/inside</q></span
              >. As it happens, this shader name already exists in our current
              set up, so we just assign this material in Blender to our strap
              surface.
            </p>

            <h5 id="first-steps-fixing-rank">Fixing the rank model</h5>
            <p>
              The rank model uses multiple shaders, because each time a player
              ranks up in xp, another shader is drawn. For that reason the
              shaders are hard coded inside the source code and change
              dynamically. Let's apply some magic again and
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >use the shader name <q>gfx/hud/ranks/rank4</q></span
              >
              for the material name of the strap surface. After using the
              <q>Shading Panel</q> again we see that the rank model is shaded by
              the texture, but the
              <span class="txt-h1">texture is meant to be transparent</span>.

              To apply our last fix we will open up the

              If everything went successful, we have a first basic character
              going in Blender, ready for screenshots, icons, and the many more
              possibilities of Blender. That concludes the import example. In
              the next chapter we will export that same character for use inside
              the game.
            </p>

            <!-- Export of the Character -->
            <h3 id="first-steps-export-character">Export of the Character</h3>
            <p>
              In this section we are going to export the character from the
              previous section to an MD3 model. This model will include the bind
              pose frame, a walking animation, and an idle animation. But before
              that, let's review what we already have.
            </p>

            <!-- Export of the Character: what we have -->
            <h4>What we have</h4>
            <p>
              In the previous section we imported, assembled and shaded a
              complete character from W:ET. We have 5 models: body, head,
              backpack, helmet and rank.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we used the shading panel to shade the model in Blender, we now
              have all shader names in Blender. These are represented as
              material names.
              <span class="txt-h2"
                >We will keep on using these material names for export</span
              >. The alternative is deleting them all again and use the object
              names inside .skin files for shading, or a mixture of both.
            </p>
            <p>
              The body model and the head model are the only models which
              contain <span class="txt-h2">animation</span>. The body model is
              animated by a skeleton. The head model is animated by shape keys.
              Since we export to MD3, this is totally fine. The
              <span class="txt-h2">skeletal data will just be converted</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we
              <span class="txt-h2">should probably clean up our tags</span>. You
              might have noticed that some names, for example "tag_mouth", end
              with ".001". Also, since we don't plan on using them anymore, we
              should exclude most of them, if not all, from the export by making
              the objects invisible. But for now we leave everything as is.
            </p>

            <!-- Export of the Character: preparing the animations -->
            <h4>Preparing the animations</h4>
            <p>
              Before we export, we must prepare our animation data. We have to
              choose which frame ranges we want to include, and modify the
              existing animations so that only a couple of animations are
              exported.
            </p>

            <h5>Deleting existing animations</h5>
            <p>
              We do not need the animations for the head model, so we will
              remove them. The imported animations are stored as actions inside
              Blender. We can delete them in the
              <span class="txt-h1">Outliner editor type</span>. There we switch
              the <span class="txt-h1">Display Mode to Blender File</span>,
              locate the <span class="txt-h1">Actions tree</span>, and delete
              every action except the <q>mdx_skeleton</q> action. We delete the
              actions by selecting them, right clicking the marked context, and
              <span class="txt-h1">clicking <q>Delete</q></span
              >.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h5>Choosing frame ranges</h5>
            <p>
              Animations for models are referenced by
              <span class="txt-h2">.anim script files</span> by the game. We can
              look into these files to get an overview. For the head model the
              script file is located at: <q>animations/human/head/base.anim</q>.
              For the body model it is located at:
              <q>animations/human/base/body.aninc</q>.
            </p>
            <p>
              From our body animation we want the bind pose frame, an idle state
              and a walking state. After opening the file for the body animation
              we choose the following frame ranges:
            </p>
            <table class="table table-dark table-striped table-bordered">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th scope="col">Animation Name</th>
                  <th scope="col">Start Frame</th>
                  <th scope="col">End Frame</th>
                  <th scope="col">Duration</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>relaxed_idle_no</td>
                  <td>1094</td>
                  <td>1312</td>
                  <td>219</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>relaxed_walk_1h_2</td>
                  <td>1458</td>
                  <td>1553</td>
                  <td>96</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Additionally, we pick frame 32 for the bind pose frame.</p>

            <h5>Editing frame ranges</h5>
            <p>
              We need to delete and move certain keyframes. For deleting the key
              frames we use markers. The markers will help us to select all key
              frames in between them, so that we can delete them. To set a
              marker go to the
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >Marker menu in the time line and click 'Add Marker'</span
              >.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We put markers on the following frames: 0, 31, 33, 1093, 1313,
              1457, 1554, 4862.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we need to
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >switch our editor type from <q>Timeline</q> to
                <q>Dope Sheet</q></span
              >. Inside the Dope Sheet Editor we
              <span class="txt-h1">switch to Action Editor</span> and
              <span class="txt-h1">select the Action called mdx_skeleton</span>.
              Then we <span class="txt-h1">select all pose bones</span> by
              selecting our armature object, switch to pose mode, and select
              them all. Finally
              <span class="txt-h1">select the markers at frame 0 and 31</span>,
              go to the <span class="txt-h1"><q>Select menu</q></span> and
              <span class="txt-h1">click <q>Between Selected Markers</q></span
              >. The selected key frames can now be deleted.
            </p>

            <p>
              After doing that for all our frame ranges, we have only 2
              animations left. We need to move them to the beginning on the time
              line. We do this by
              <span class="txt-h1"
                >selecting them, and pressing 'G' to drag them around</span
              >. If everything went successful, you should have your key frames
              set up, ready for export.

              <span class="txt-h1">hide its collection</span> in the outliner.
              Finally,

                        each vertex and keep your UV island count as low as
                        possible.

            <h3 id="export-md3-mdc">MD3 and MDC</h3>
            <p>
              MD3 and MDC are both morph based formats. You can prepare your
              model in Blender and export to both of these formats without
              problems. However, you can not export to MDS or MDM/MDX, because
              these require a skeleton.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-md3-mdc-basic">Basic</h4>
            <p>
              The steps are: create the geometry (a cube for demonstration),
              triangulate it, uv unwrap it, add a material to it and name the
              material according to the conventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the material name the addon expects a path relative to the
              game path. This path is called a "shader name" by the game. It is
              either a script located in .shader file, or it is just a .tga or
              .jpg texture. For this example we use: "textures/props/box_m05a".
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure class="remt-pic-explain">

              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to use .skin files instead of material names for
              shading, you there is no need for a material with a special name,
              because in that case, the object names become important.
            </p>

            <h4 id="export-md3-mdc-animation">Animation</h4>
            <p>
              Animation can be done by using absolute shape keys (relative shape
              keys are not supported) or object transforms. If you do not need
              animation, just set your frame count to 1 in the timeline, but you
              can also export multiple, static frames.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you animate with shape keys make sure you have triangulated
              your objects geometry, because Blender does not support
              triangulation after the object has been shape keyed.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-md3-mdc-tags">Tags</h4>
            <p>
              Tags are represented as Empty objects in Blender. They need to
              have display type 'Arrows' and their name needs to start with
              'tag_'. Tags can be parented to any other object.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some models exclusively contain tags, for example first person
              models. Therefore the addon supports exporting tags only.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-md3-mdc-export">Export</h4>
            <p>
              To export your model, just make the collection containing your
              objects active and then use the export panel. The addon will read
              all objects contained in the collection and sub-collections. If
              you want to exclude certain objects, just make the object
              invisible in the viewport.
            </p>

            <h3 id="export-mds-mdm-mdx">MDS and MDM/MDX</h3>
            <p>
              MDS and MDM/MDX are both skeletal based formats. You can prepare
              your model in Blender and export to all of the formats, even morph
              based ones.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-mds-mdm-mdx-basic">Basic</h4>
            <p>
              The steps are: create the geometry (a cylinder for demonstration),
              triangulate it, uv unwrap it, add a material to it and name the
              material according to the conventions. Then create an armature and
              parent your object to the armature. Make sure that each vertex has
              a maximum of 3 weights. This is a format requirement.

              For the bones: these will need a "Fixed Distance" constraint on
              each pose bone. Additionally all bones should have a "Torso
              Weight" property and on one of them there needs to be a "Torso
              Parent" property present. See section
              <a href="#export-blender-data-armature-object">Blender Data</a>
              for more details.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-mds-mdm-mdx-animation">Animation</h4>
            <p>
              Animation is done exclusively by animating pose bones or animating
              the object transforms of the armature. You can not use shape keys
              alongside skeletal animation, nor can you animate tags themselves
              (they need to be animated by the bone). There might be problems
              with scaling the armature. See section
              <a href="#limitations-armature-scaling">Armature Scaling</a> for
              more details.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not need animation, just set your frame count to 1 in
              the timeline, but you can also export multiple, static frames.
            </p>
            <h4 id="export-mds-mdm-mdx-tags">Tags</h4>
            <p>
              Tags are represented as Empty objects in Blender. They need to
              have display type 'Arrows' and their name needs to start with
              'tag_'. Tags can be parented to any other object, but if you
              export to MDS or MDM/MDX you need to have your tags parented to a
              pose bone. Additionally, the tag itself can not be animated, the
              formats require the parent bone to animate the tag.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tags exported for MDS additionally need a "Torso Weight" property.
              See section
              <a href="#export-blender-data-arrow-object"
                >Data Overview - Arrow objects</a

              To export your model, just make the collection containing your
              objects active and then use the export panel. The addon will read
              all objects contained in the collection and sub-collections. If
              you want to exclude certain objects, just make the object
              invisible in the viewport.
            </p>

            <h3 id="export-convertability">Convertability</h3>
            <p>
              If you use the "Direct Conversion" Panel or are exporting a model
              prepared in Blender, then the addon converts your data in a best
              effort. In a nutshell: you can export or convert your data into
              all directions except for MD3 and MDC to MDS and MDM/MDX. The
              reason is that MDS and MDM/MDX require a skeleton to animate their
              vertices and tags. MD3 and MDC do not contain skeletal data.
              Reconstructing this data is not easy.

              By clicking the attachment button the attachment operation will
              start. If successful, it will parent a set of objects to a tag
              object. It will therefore align the objects origin to the location
              and orientation of the tag object.

            <h3 id="limitations-armature-scaling">Armature Scaling</h3>
            <p>
              When scaling an armature of an imported model, then this will
              distort the mesh due to a "Fixed Distance" constraint put on each
              pose bone. If you want to scale the armature nontheless then you
              need to disable the constraint. However, the addon expects the
              constraint to be present again during export. Also, if you scaled
              the armature, then you need to apply the scaling to the object
              transforms of the bones. This is a current limitation, because the
              addon does not read the scaling values for bones.

            <p>
              Modifiers, constraints and drivers are generally not supported
              with the exception of an "Armature" modifier on an armature and a
              "Fixed Distance" constraint on the pose bones.
